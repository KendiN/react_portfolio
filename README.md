# Q&A

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### What is NPM?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a is a package manager for Javascript which is used to manage, install and share packages for Node.js. It also provides dependency management by automatically handling a project's dependencies, ensuring that the right library versions are installed and avoiding conflicts between various packages.

### What is SPA?

SPA (Single Page Application) is a web application which that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server. SPA leverages technologies such as AJAX, HTML5 and even Fetch API to retrieve data from the server without the page fully reloading. This allows for dynamic updates and provides users with a seamless and smooth experience.
SPAs also implement client-side routing which enables the application to update the content without navigating to a new page on the server. SPA faces challenges with search engine optimization (SEO), potential initial load time issues due to larger initial JavaScript payloads, and the need for careful management of client-side state.
